# TacacsGUI
Free Access Control Server for Your Network Devices.
GUI for powerful [tacacs daemon by Marc Huber](http://www.pro-bono-publico.de/projects/)

## How to install
Old [Installation Script](https://github.com/tacacsgui/tgui_install). fixed for **Debian 12** bare-metal installation supported locally (but not uploaded right now).

The status of project is WIP. Code of project fixed to works on Debian 12 and PHP 8.2, but a lot of crap inside. Must be refactored a bit more that full.
